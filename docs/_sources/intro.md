# Welcome to your Jupyter Book on Time Series

This is a small book (or, as of now, a set of notes) to give you a *feel* for **time series analysis and forecasting** (with some application to finance).

It does not go in-depth into any particular topic. If you are intereted on how to make books liek this, check out [the Jupyter Book documentation](https://jupyterbook.org) for more information about Jupyter books.

**Topics** (I hope to cover)

- Basic probability & statistics
  + normal/t/F distributions
  + hypothesis testing
- Simple return vs Log returns
- Basic trading models
  + MACD
  + RSI
  + Bollinger Bands
- Basic Time Series Concepts
  + White noise
  + Stationary/Non-stationary series
  + ACF/PACF
  + Unit-root Tests
- Linear Models
  + Moving Average
  + General Approach to Modeling Time Series
  + Trend Estimation
  + Backshift or Lag Operator
  + Seasonality Estimation
  + Autoregressive Model
  + ARIMA(p,d,q)
- Measuring Forecasting Performance
  + Bias/MSE/RMSE/SE
  + MAE/MPE/MAPE
  + Theil's U1/U2
  + Decomposition (Bias, Variance, Covariance proportion)
- Bivariate Time Series Models
  + Spurious regression
  + Dynamic model
  + Granger Causality
  + Co-integration & Engle-Granger test
  + Error Correction Model (ECM)
- Multivariate Time Series Models
  + VAR
